## helloworld.js

helloworld.js is a project exploring the design of an extensible procedural kernel that empowers creators to author computational worlds through real-time interaction. The project investigates how procedural algorithms and object-oriented systems can enable applications of world-building, computational design, and creative expression to emerge from a web-based system. This research examines the intersection of procedural content generation, interactive 3D environments, and collaborative creation tools, drawing inspiration from games like Minecraft, Spore, and Dwarf Fortress while leveraging modern web technologies to create a lightweight, accessible platform for computational world-building. The project explores computational challenges including network capabilities for real-time interaction, lightweight browser-based execution, peer-to-peer collaboration, and universal accessibility across devices.
