                When building a sandbox for collaborative storytelling, we wanted to go beyond individual characters and
                plots. We wanted to create a framework where players could experiment with worlds; with societies,
                ideologies, and environments that shape the lives within them. That is why utopia and dystopia are at
                the heart of our aesthetic vision.
            </p>
            <p>
                In our sandbox, players can construct their own utopian experiments. These worlds serve both as
                aspirational blueprints and as provocations. What happens when ideals meet human complexity? Sir Thomas
                More’s Utopia offered one of the earliest thought experiments in designing a perfect society. His
                imagined island featured communal property, rational governance, and social harmony. But, it was also a
                satire, inviting readers to question whether perfection on paper can ever align with the
                complexities of human life.

                Frank Lloyd Wright’s Broadacre City imagined a suburban utopia of decentralized living, where every
                family had land and technology connected people across distances. It was visionary but also deeply tied
                to American ideals of property and mobility.

                The Panopticon, for example, designed by philosopher Jeremy Bentham, was a circular prison where every
                inmate could be watched by a single guard, an architecture of total visibility and control. Today, it
                serves as a metaphor for surveillance culture. In our sandbox, players might design a city whose layout
                enforces obedience, or test what happens when every citizen lives under the gaze of authority.

                Novels like George Orwell’s 1984 and Aldous Huxley’s Brave New World showed two dystopias. 1984 imagines
                totalitarian control through fear, surveillance, and repression, while Brave New World depicts a society
                lulled into obedience by comfort, pleasure, and distraction. Together, they frame two poles of dystopia:
                oppression by pain, and oppression by pleasure.

                Similarly, John B. Calhoun’s “mouse utopia” experiments, often called the “Behavioral Sink”, tested what
                happens when a population of mice lives in a space of abundance but limited structure. The result was
                chaos: overcrowding, social collapse, and the eventual extinction of the colony.
            </p>

                We don’t present utopia and dystopia as opposites, but as two sides of the same coin. Every utopia
                contains the seeds of dystopia, and every dystopia reflects a distorted dream of order. Could either
                ever trully exist? As the original etymology for these words, aetopia, decribes a place of "nowhere." In
                our sandbox, players are not given answers but possibilities.
            </p>

                However, by weaving utopian and dystopian aesthetics into our storytelling framework, we allow players
                to grapple with the essential question of world-building: not just what is possible, but what is
                desirable, and at what cost.
