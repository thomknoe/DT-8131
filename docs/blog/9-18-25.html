            <p>
                Every game world carries an aesthetic. A logic of images, symbols, and forms that makes it feel alive.
                For us, aesthetics are not decoration but the foundation of meaning. They come from real cultural
                systems: how we design money, how institutions project power, how buildings encode hierarchy, how
                stories circulate through society. These are the raw materials we draw on to build a fictional sandbox
                where players can invent their own narratives.They interpret conflict, and how they project themselves
                into the narrative.
            </p>

            </figure>
            <p>
                Our aesthetic is not arbitrary. It is drawn from the very systems that shape how we see the world: law,
                culture, technology, and national identity. By reimagining these systems inside the game, we give
                players both a familiar grammar to build on and a critical space to reinvent it.
            </p>

            <p>
                Human societies rely on “invisible social contracts”. Things like money, law, ethics, nations, religion,
                flags, fashion, etc. These are not natural, but constructed. They enable large-scale cooperation beyond
                face-to-face or intimate relations. These fictions become powerful because they are accepted, often
                unconsciously; their symbols, codes, and forms acquire legitimacy through repetition and design.
            </p>

            </figure>

            <p>
                Symbolism, design, visual codes help make these social fictions recognisable across contexts (time,
                place, culture). Visual trust is built through familiar motifs (seals, typography, emblems) that signal
                legitimacy. For example, currency design: things like official seals, signatures, standard typography,
                images of national symbols all help people trust and identify the currency.

            <p>
                Social fictions evolve at different speed; fashion shifts quickly, while cultural norms and institutions
                change more slowly. Our game reflects this by allowing players to design both the fleeting (styles,
                appearances, trends) and the enduring (laws, myths, monuments). The interplay between the two creates
                dynamic storytelling possibilities.
            </p>

            </figure>

            <p>
                Just as blockchain, Web3, and virtual worlds create new forms of legitimacy through their aesthetics,
                our game provides a space where players can invent their own emerging systems. What does a decentralised
                economy look like in your dystopian city? How does virtual faith spread through symbols? We give players
                the creative tools to define this.
            </p>

            </figure>

            <p>
                Every aesthetic choice reinforces or resists certain power structures. Our game is designed not just to
                replicate existing systems, but to allow players to question them. By designing the symbols of a
                fictional state, or rewriting the codes of morality, players engage in critique as much as creation.
            </p>

            </figure>

            <p>
                In moments when old narratives collapse and new ones emerge, symbols become a way of orientation. Our
                sandbox offers precisely this: a stage where players use visual, cultural, and narrative cues to
                stabilize their imagined worlds, or to dismantle them.
