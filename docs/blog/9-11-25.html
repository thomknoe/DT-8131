            <p>
                When we set out to design our sandbox storytelling game, we knew interaction had to be more than
                mechanics; it had to be a way of making stories feel alive. We wanted players to not only build worlds,
                but also to observe, shape, and live through the dramas that unfold inside them. Our vision of
                interaction draws inspiration from a wide range of games across genres, each teaching us something
                unique about how people and worlds connect.
            </p>

                We are fascinated by simulations where everyday actions, such as eating working, and making friends,
                slowly evolve into complex narratives. These showed us that real interaction lies not in grand events
                but in small details. That’s why we want players to not only build spaces but also observe the
                micro-actions that give rise to living stories.

            <p>
                Some sandbox experiences taught us that when players are given full freedom, they are not just building
                stages, but breathing worlds. We want to extend this same sense of possibility: giving players as much
                freedom as possible, and letting unexpected stories emerge from their creations.

                We are inspired by games that move between scales; tracking individual growth on one hand, and
                collective evolution on the other. We aim to create a system where players can focus both on individual
                psychology and on the broader rules of society. The interplay between small choices and large systems
                will be central to our vision.

                Character creation also inspires us deeply. We admire systems that allow for open, inclusive
                self-expression, where anyone can see themselves reflected. In our game, multiple identities and
                narratives will coexist, making room for players to create characters across diverse genders, bodies,
                and cultures.

                Finally, text-based games showed us that words alone can carry entire universes. A single line of
                dialogue, a branching sentence, can hold just as much weight as visual spectacle. We want to bring this
                into our sandbox: letting players shape not just spaces, but conversations and relationships, so stories
                emerge on both structural and narrative levels.
            </p>

            <p>
                We want to build a game where creation and observation coexist. A space that combines free construction,
                detailed simulation, diverse representation, systemic interaction, and narrative branching. We are
                making this because we believe the most meaningful interactions are the ones where stories happen
                naturally in the player’s hands.
